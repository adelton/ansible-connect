# Test Ansible network_cli connection

This script provides a quick and dirty way to test the Ansible network_cli
connection plugin.  This script will connect to a remote host and issue a 
set of commands.  It is currently hardcoded to work with Linux hosts as 
opposed to network devices but the mechanics are the same.  This script
will bypass most of the internal Ansible machine and direclty invoke the 
connection plugin.

In order to use this script, the following environment variables must be
set.

```
export ANSIBLE_CLICONF_PLUGINS=$PWD/cliconf_plugins
export ANSIBLE_TERMINAL_PLUGINS=$PWD/terminal_plugins
```

To run the script, issue the following command:

```
$ python connect.py 192.168.10.1 -u ansible -P ansible
```

This script has been tested to work with Ansible 2.7 or later and Fedora 29.

This script is made available for free as-is for testing only and is not 
maintaned or supported
